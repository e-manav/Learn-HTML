        <p>
            We’ve gone from having 21 elements in HTML tags, that first document, to having 100 more elements now, and
            yet
            it’s still the same language. I find that amazing. It’s still the same language that was created 25 years
            ago.
            It’s grown an extra 100 elements in there, and yet it’s still the same language.
